## Background

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, everyone is required to take the vaccine to take control of the range of spreading the virus. As a result, vaccine organization is important. Poor management can cause, for example, overcrowding and inadequate injection which then leads to the new wave of COVID-19 spreading.

</br>

## Description

To prevent these issues, we decided to create an application that can manage the whole system of vaccine reservations including many features such as patient appointments. Using the VaccineHaven application, we can decrease the number of infected patients because we can reserve the vaccine inside of it. With the given information from the user (name, id), the application can take the data from the government database and provide the nearest vaccine service site with useful information.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). And you have to
install [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and install the LTS version of Node JS.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more
information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will
remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right
into your project, so you have full control over them. All the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will
point to the copied scripts, so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you
shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't
customize it when you are ready for it.
